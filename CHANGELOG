  *) tokenizer.h: changed token name T_NEWLINE to
      to T_EOL

  *) tokenizer.c (reset): added argument `to' for
      token

  *) vvtbi.c: removed Lines data structure, replaced
      with line-searching algorithm to remove space and
      memory limitation; additionally replacing previous
      (disgusting) fseek method for GOTO and similar pro-
      cedures


Changes with vvtbi 1.2.1
                                                2011-06-10
  *) tokenizer.c (tokenizer_variable_num): added
      better char compatibility

  *) io.c: the `next' character is now stored
      within a variable, replacing fseek -1


Changes with vvtbi 1.2

  *) io.c (stream): removed function from io.c

  *) main.c: moved open/close logic to io.c

  *) *: all line-statements must now end with a
      new-line character

  *) vvtbi.c (print_statement): fixed unexpected
      behavior that occurs if print is last state-
      ment without trailing new-line

  *) vvtbi.c (variables): changed variable container
      in vvtbi.c from type char[] to int[]
